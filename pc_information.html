								<p>New players are often suggested to try out NPCing for their first few games. So let's talk about what that means!</p>
								<h3>What is an NPC?</h3>
								<p>An NPC, or Non-Player Character, is someone who plays multiple characters and monsters throughout the course of a weekend game. NPCs are given roles at the behest of plot, and then asked to play them for a short period of time. These roles may be monsters that the PCs will fight, characters the PCs will interact with, and so forth.</p>
								<h3>What do NPCs DO?</h3>
								<p>NPCs do lots of things, from fighting to role playing. In some roles, you'll be asked to fight, in others you'll be asked to share information with the PCs, or Player Characters, while in still others, you'll be adding to the realism of the world by having thoughts and problems for the PCs to interact with.</p>
								<p>Refuge Portland is committed to ensuring our NPCs are treated well. It's a long-standing tradition to give them access to a list of roles called a Cast List, and let them choose roles for the weekend that interest them and deliver story content. We want our NPCs to walk away from a weekend feeling like they got to influence the PCs, have meaningful interactions with them, and enjoy the game as much as the PCs did.</p>
								<p>To that end, if there is something you would like to see happen, or some way you would like to be utilized, please let a plot member know! We can't make promises, but we'll try our best to accomodate your needs and wants.</p>
								<h3>What is Monster Camp?</h3>
								<p>Monster Camp is where the NPCs hang out. It's where plot tells you what the next events are, where you prep for them, where NPC garb (we provide period clothes for you to wear) and snacks are stored, and where we congregate as a community in between activities. PCs will come to Monster Camp on occasion when they need to interact with an NPC or plot for some reason, and are universally greeted with the call "PC on deck!" It's generally considered an Out of Game (OOG) environment, so sometimes PCs will come by to just chill OOG for a little while before returning to game. When they're around, NPCs need to be careful of what they say to avoid spoiling surprises.</p>
								<h3>Do I need to know the rules/how to fight/etc?</h3>
								<p>Nope! We'll teach you everything you need to know over the course of the weekend. It may be beneficial to give the rules a once-over or two, but if you learn better by doing or the rulebook is too impenetrable, you are welcome to just skip it and come to game without an ounce of prior exposure. This is one of the reasons people recommend NPCing for new players! It's a great way to learn the rules!</p>
								<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
								<p>THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BRING IS A GOOD ATTITUDE. Everything else, beyond maybe underwear, we can help you figure out. But a good attitude - or as good of one as you can muster - is key to success in the game.</p>
								<p>If you've got the attitude down, and want to know what else to pack, we can help you out! Try bringing...</p>
								<ul>
									<li>SOCKS and underwear. Bring at least TWICE as many sock as you think you'll need. Dry feet are heaven in the PNW, and help you avoid hypothermia!</li>
									<li>Black clothes. NPCs generally wear black clothing under their costuming to keep warm, and so you can quick-change in Monster Camp.</li>
									<li>Sleeping Gear. You'll always be given a bed in or around Monster Camp, and those beds generally have mattresses, so all you need is a pillow and a sleeping bag. If you have a CPAP, you can check in with <a href="mailto:logistics@refugelarpportland.com">Logistics</a> about how to get power for your CPAP.</li>
									<li>Good boots. Good boots are worth their weight in gold at an event like Refuge. Make sure you break them in before you join us. They don't necessarily need to look period, although that helps, so don't go out and buy anything fancy. Just make sure they fit and are comfortable.</li>
									<li>A camping chair. Monster camp is generally outside (although we do have pop-ups to keep things shaded and out of the rain), so be sure to bring a camping chair to sit in. If you don't have one, we usually have a few extras running around, but it's safer not to count on it.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Are there any benefits to NPCing?</h3>
								<p>Yes!</p>
								<p>NPCing is one of the best ways to learn the rules a bit more slowly and at your comfort level. You can focus on just fighting or just spell casting or just alchemy for a time, then branch out into the others. You also get the support of long-term players who will be able to more readily go OOG with you to explain what the rules are for any given mechanic. And people don't expect the same degree of knowledge out of new NPCs as they do  out of new PCs.</p>
								<p>In a similar vein, you get to try out new builds and see which ones you like. Don't know if your PC should be a scholar or a fighter? You can explore with both of them for a weekend and see which one makes more sense for you. Just be sure to let Plot know your desires!</p>
								<p>NPCs also earn all sorts of rewards. In addition to the regular XP granted by a weekend, NPCs get an extra blanket per game they attend per month. Basically, NPCs get an extra day of build per month when they NPC. You can talk to <a href="mailto:logistics@refugelarpportland.com">logistics</a> for more information about this. Beyond that, NPCs also earn Chapter Points for their attendance, which you can find out more about by checking out our <a href="coming_soon.html">staff compensation policy</a> page. Finally, NPCs <b>play for free!</b> They need to pay for the NPC meal plan if they wish to partake of it, but they don't pay anything to game with us.</p>
								<p>The NPC meal plan is a meal plan put together by our staff that allows NPCs to eat pre-cooked meals for the weekend. Buy-in is normally around $20, and we will do our best to serve your allergies, if you tell us ahead of time. The meal plan serves Friday dinner, three meals on Saturday, and Sunday brekfast. You MUST be an NPC to buy into this meal plan.</p>
								<p>NPCing gives you the chance to make some friends before you join the PC side. Maybe you meet some NPCs who you want to come into game with, or you interact with some cool PCs, which gives you an in with their story. NPCing gives you a chance to make friends and ask questions before you join up and start PCing, which is super nice.</p>
								<p>One of the biggest benefits, if you talk to newer players, is not having to find your own garb before game. Monster Camp supplies garb in all sizes, and you are welcome to come and use our garb instead of bringing your own when you NPC. Some NPCs and plot members will bring their own garb to supplement for specific characters, but everything you need should be available to you in Monster Camp.</p>
								<p>If you're interested in ever running your own LARP, or would like to know more about joining a plot team, NPCing is a great way to learn! We teach people of all sorts our tricks and tools, letting people learn along with us. We also have some special teams you can join to become an OOG leader of our Monster Camp, so there are great opportunities for advancement as an NPC.</p>
								<p>Speaking of other teams, both our campaigns have what are known as NPC Guilds. Guild members are NPCs who show up regularly and have made a commitment to at least 1 year of gaming as an NPC. We expect these NPCs to show up to every game, although we know life happens some times, and give them first choice of roles, prior information about the plot, more influence over stories, etc. Most guild members have at least one character who was written explicitly for them. The other team that you can join as a member of the main plot is Plot-Prentices. This team is a small group of NPCs who want to learn how to write plot. They have regular meetings with the plot team, are assigned writing duties, and are allowed creative influence on the game in a really meaningful way. Contact <a href="mailto:plot@refugelarpportland.com">plot</a> if you are interestsed in engaging with the team in this way.</p>
								<p>Snacks! Monster Camp is always filled with snacks. You are welcome to bring some to share, or let plot know about your snack preferences, and we'll try and hook you up.</p>
								<h3>What should I expect at my first game?</h3>
								<p>First games can be super daunting. Here's what to expect from your first game as an NPC:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>When you arrive on site, find Monster Camp. Anyone who's been to game once or twice can help you find it. If you can't find someone to help out, find the parking lot or tavern and hang around looking lost until someone finds you. Our experienced players LOVE helping new folks, so feel free to keep asking until someone can help you out.</li>
									<li>Monster Camp will probably be in its setup phase when  you arrive. Find a plot member or NPC Guildie, and they can direct you to where to put your gear for sleeping. Go! Unpack! Then come back to Monster Camp and start helping out. Don't worry if you don't know where anything goes, someone will be able to help you sort it all out.</li>
									<li>Plot will be running around super stressed (there's no such thing as a chill plot member right before game), but they will be SO HAPPY YOU'RE THERE. No, seriously, they will want to get to know you and talk to you, and may ask you to come with them as they walk around site putting out Info Cards and phys-reps for different things. Plot <b>loves</b> new NPCs, especially ones ready and eager to help out.</li>
									<li>Once Monster Camp is set up, you should try and find some time to walk around site. It will help you get your bearings later in the evening when the fun begins. Feel free to drag another NPC with you, or even a plot member. Anyone will be happy to help you find what you need or just look around the area.</li>
									<li>This is also a great time to get a primer on how to fight. Ask ANY Guild member or plot member to give you a hand learning how to fight, and they will be glad to show you how (or find someone to help you).</li>
									<li>This is also a good time to read up on what's going to happen this weekend. Monster Camp should have a schedule or two running around and a Cast List and other things to read to find out what you need to know for the weekend's plot. Please ask someone before you go looking through a schedule, however, as one binder usually has key items in it and should only be touched by Plot.</li>
									<li>As our start time (game on) approaches, you'll want to check in with Logistics. Logistics is usually set up around 5-6pm, so if you get to site a little later, you may want to head straight there, then go to Monster Camp. Either is fine. Check in there, and be sure to bring your money if you didn't prepay for NPC food. You'll need to sign a legal release, and then you can leave. NPCs can skip the line, so if there is one, just walk up to the table and ask about checking in.</li>
									<li>Once you're all checked in, go eat NPC food, if it's ready. Dinner is usually served before game starts, so now is a great opportunity to eat. If not, you <i>will</i> get a chance to eat later (take one if one isn't offered to you!). Eat when you need to. Plot won't get angry.</li>
									<li>Right before opening announcements, there will be a little chat in Monster Camp for all the NPCs and Plot. Plot will go over things like notes about the game, help you get into costumes, highlight key points of NPC culture, and have other general announcements. If you aren't getting checked in or eating, it's a good idea to hang around in Monster Camp waiting for this meeting.</li>
									<li>Once that meeting is over, everyone will trek over to the Tavern for opening announcements. Once announcements are over, you'll begin game! You should have received instructions by now from either a Guildie or a Plot member as to what role you'll be serving for the first "mod" of the night, so go get ready for that. If you have questions, ask a Guildie or Plot member, and they will be more than happy to answer any questions you have.</li>
									<li>The rest of the weekend will be filled with "mods", downtime and eating. Expect to be run a little ragged, as NPCing is a fun, if draining, gig. TAKE NAPS AND BREAKS WHEN YOU NEED THEM. No one will be upset with you for needing a nap or to chill. Monster Camp is usually open from 9am to 2am, but you are NOT expected to be there that whole time. Get food when you need it, take breaks when you need it, lie down when you need it. Plot wants you at your best, and you're only at your best when you're rested enough. There are regular meal times, and Plot can communicate those to you when you arrive, if you have concerns about them. Plus, there are always snacks.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>That's about it. If you have questions beyond that, contacting plot is generally the easiest way to get answers (check the <a href="contact.htm">Contact Us</a> page for information on how to do that. We're so excited you're considering NPCing for us!</p>

							<p>Cory is not only the Chapter Owner of Refuge Calgary, he loves to build new characters with people.

We are going into our 8th season and only now do we have characters that are above 20th level. Don't get discouraged when you see players doing a lot of damage, casting powerful spells etc. They have been playing for a while!</em></p>

								<p><em>&quot;</em><em>Now the one thing you will note is I have not given builds for the
										&quot;Hybrid
										Classes&quot; such as Spellsword and Adept. There is a reason for it. If you are a
										starting
										character, stick with one of the above basics. You can switch into a Spellsword,
										Adept or Scout later
										in the game. These above suggestions will really help you jump into the game
										without too many
										concerns about building up your character.</em></p>
								<p><em>One of my best pieces of advise is this: Plan for the long term after your first
										game. Think
										about where you want to be when you are level 20 and then work back. It sounds
										daunting, but
										really it is not once you understand the skill system, which we will teach
										you.&quot;</em> -Cory,
