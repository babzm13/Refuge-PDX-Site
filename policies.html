						<h1 class="title">Safety Policies and Rules</h1>
          <p>Refuge LARP has many policies in place to  ensure that our game is safe and enjoyable to everyone. Each event will have at  least one designated Safety Marshall. ONLY these Marshals are permitted to  move during Safety Holds (see Holds below).<br>
            While we maintain a dedicated safety team as well  as comprehensive insurance (for everyone, including those coming out as a  trial-members) we would rather prevent injuries than treat them.</p>
          
            <h2 class="title"><i class="far fa-hand-paper"></i> The Pause Game Rule</h2>
          
          <p>While it is stated quite clearly in the rule book,  we will restate it here. The most important rule in Refuge is the &ldquo;Pause Game  Rule&rdquo;. Simply put, when you hear the word &rdquo;Pause Game!&rdquo; shouted, you must take a knee  if able, and look at the ground. Pauses are called when someone notices a safety  issue. This is not a time to look around for people sneaking up on you but you  may go through your tags to track your abilities remaining. A Pause will end  when the caller of the Pause does a three count to&rdquo;game on&rdquo;. If you see an  immediate safety concern, call &ldquo;Pause Game&rdquo; in a loud voice. It is better to have an  extra Pause, or two, then to have an injury. But remember, Pauses are primarily for  safety issues and are NOT intended for asking rules questions or clarifying an  effect a monster or player is using.</p>
          
            <h1 class="title"><i class="fas fa-comment-slash"></i> Harassment</h1>
            
            <p> Harassment  of others,verbally, physically, sexually or otherwise, is illegal and strictly prohibited in our  campaign. Players whose behaviour can be construed as harassment will be asked  to stop immediately. If the behaviour continues past that point, that player  will be banned permanently from the game. We are trying to create a fun and  safe game atmosphere; harassment of players and/or staff does not belong. Any  player that feels they are being harassed should bring the matter immediately  to the attention of the Owner and/or General Manager.<br>
              <br>
              Types of harassment include, but are not limited to: bullying, psychological  harassment, racial harassment, religious harassment, sexual harassment,  stalking, mobbing, hazing, and hate speech.<br>
  <br>
              Any questions about the definition of harassment should be directed to the  Owner and/or General Manager.</p>
            <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> This rule extends outside of game and includes all interactions on any of our social media platforms, or communication with any member of our LARP.<br>
            </p>
            
              <h2 class="title"> &ldquo;Creepy Martin&rdquo; Rule</h2>
            
            <p> Players are  expected to stay within the bounds of reasonable taste, and avoid causing  discomfort to other players. Any player receiving complaints about their  conduct will receive ample warnings and the opportunity to adjudicate the  matter if they feel the complaints are unwarranted or constitute harassment. If  legitimately offensive or &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; conduct does not show significant and  sustained improvement after the warnings, Refuge Calgary reserves the right  to ban the player as per our policy on harassment.<br>
            </p>
            
              <h2 class="title"><i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles"></i> &quot;Tapout&quot; Rule</h2>
            
We write &quot;High Fantasy&quot; adventures. Some times these involve mature themes, horror and people's personal phobias. We do try to ensure that any adventure that may have these themes are explained before to players participating. If you find yourself in a scene such as this and you feel you cannot comfortably continue with it, you may be excused by the Marshal on scene. The only caveat is that you stay within the mod area, or go OOG until the scene is over. If something dire does befall your comrades, you may be subject to the same consequences (such as taking a death, or being incarcerated in-game). This will be up to the Marshal and Plot's discretion.

  <h2 class="title"><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Ban-worthy Actions </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Out-of-game  theft</li>
  <li>Out-of-game  physical assault</li>
  <li>Threats of OOG violence to other players at Refuge. </li>
  <li>Multiple  OOG verbal altercations with other players or staff (evaluated on a  case-by-case basis)</li>
  <li>Harassment,  sexual or otherwise, of other players or staff</li>
  <li>Repeated,  purposeful cheating/rules-breaking</li>
  <li>Willful  defacement or destruction of property</li>
  <li>Any  convicted sex offender found to be playing in the campaign will be immediately  banned and escorted from the site </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title"><i class="fas fa-baby"></i> Age to Play</h2>
        
         
            <h2 class="title"><i class="fas fa-file-medical"></i> Playing as a Page</h2>
          
          <p>In order to allow  players that cannot safely engage in combat to enjoy LARPing, such players may  &ldquo;Page&rdquo; for an event. Any player with an illness or physical circumstance that  prohibits their involvement in combat should Page for their own safety. Pages  must wear a clearly visible orange headband with the word &ldquo;PAGE&rdquo; written across  the front. Pages may not remove or hide this headband in any fashion throughout  the weekend, except when in obviously OOG areas. The following rules apply to  Pages are non-negotiable:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pages  may NOT enter combat in any way. This includes, but is not limited to: </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Giving  potions to unconscious bodies on a battlefield.</li>
              <li>Being  within 25 feet of any combat – a Page within that range when a combat breaks out  should make every effort to move away as soon as possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Pages  may not use or carry a weapon, and may not throw spells or alchemy. Pages may  touch-cast spells and use all alchemy with the exception of gases (which must  be thrown).</li>
            <li>Any  player found to be &ldquo;player bashing&rdquo; a Page (see rule book for definition) will  receive a warning card from a Marshall.</li>
            <li>If at  any time a Page acts outside these guidelines and the spirit in which they are  intended, they will be asked to leave the event for their own safety.</li>
          </ul>
          
            <h2 class="title"><i class="fas fa-bed"></i> Out of Game (OOG)</h2>
          
          <p>All players are considered In Game for the entirety of the time they are  on-site during game hours, unless they are wearing an easily visible white headband. All items stored in a container or clearly marked OOG are considered  personal possessions and are not stealable. In Game (IG) items may NOT be  stored in an OOG container or vehicle – doing so is considered cheating.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to wearing a white headband, players in the bathroom are also OOG.  Players may not be attacked or threatened while in the bathroom.<br>
  <br>
            Players may not retreat to an OOG area in order to avoid combat or threatening  IG situations.</p>

          <h3 class="title"><i class="fas fa-book-dead"></i> Other &quot;Camp Rules&quot;</h3>
          
            <h2 class="title"><i class="fas fa-hourglass-start"></i> Quiet Time</h2>
          
          <p> During our weekend events  we want to maintain a safe environment and that includes sleep. From 2am until  9am there will be no combat events without notice by PLOT or the GM, and those  instances will be very rare indeed. You are more than welcome to continue to  talk and interact, but we ask that you respect the players that have chosen to  get some shut eye by not speaking or interacting near the sleeping areas. We  will try to ensure that the &ldquo;tavern area&rdquo; is always available for you. </p>
          
            <h2 class="title"><i class="fab fa-free-code-camp"></i> Kitchen/Cook Area </h2>
          
          <p> The kitchen or cooking area of the camp is a  special &ldquo;No Combat&rdquo; IG zone. Players that are in the kitchen when combat breaks  out have the option of joining the combat immediately, or waiting until it is  over. Players may not retreat to the kitchen and then pop in-and-out in order  to avoid being struck in combat. Doing so will have a 3 count by a Marshal. If  the PC does not exit by the 3 count the player will be slain and must move to a  resurrection circle immediately, dropping all possessions in the process.<br>
          </p>
          
            <h2 class="title"><i class="fab fa-optin-monster"></i> Monster Camp </h2>
          
          <p> Monster Camp is where all the NPCs gear up for their modules. Monster Camp is a restricted OOG area. PCs must  announce themselves when approaching Monster Camp, using the words &ldquo;PC incoming&rdquo;  or something similar. PCs may not enter Monster Camp until they are invited in.  This policy is not intended to make players feel excluded, but rather to allow  the Plot Runners to speak freely to the NPCs without worrying that they might  ruin the weekend for a paying player by revealing information that would force  the player to sit out that portion of the weekend&rsquo;s event.</p>
          <hr>
          <h1 class="title">Expectations for an enjoyable event!</h1>
          
            <h2 class="title">Sportsmanship and Courtesy</h2>
          
          <p>Sounds pretty simple huh? Well you would hope so, but we need to go over a few things just in case you are unaware:</p>
          
            <h2 class="title"><i class="fas fa-crown"></i> General &quot;Life in Medieval times&quot; primer:</h2>
          
          <p> Please remember that when you arrive you will be in another &ldquo;world&rdquo;. For  those of you that may never read anything about medieval life you should come  prepared with a few tidbits:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Any NPC of authority (King, Magistrate, Sheriff or Guard) must be  treated as you would if you met a real world leader (the Prime Minister, Judge,  Police etc). Remember that treating these NPCs disrespectfully (verbally or  physically) will more than likely have your character sitting in the &ldquo;stocks&rdquo;  for an uncomfortable period of time. Depending on their rank, you character  could even be put to death. We will do our best to identify these NPCs through  the use of Sashes across their bodies as well as pictures of these NPCs at the  entrance to the event.</li>
            <li>While we understand that there are modern world items that you will  bring with you, each player must ensure that they are not used in an IG area (yes the Kitchen at Camp is still an IG area).  Cellphones, iPods, laptops etc are strictly prohibited during the events. If  you need to use these devices, please go back to your vehicle. Any person  caught using these items during an event will be asked to leave. Watches and  glasses are permitted, but you must conceal your watch at all times (many  players cover their watch with an arm guard or bracer).</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="title">Player Expectations</h3>
          <!-- contentbox /box4 -->
          <p>Refuge Calgary expects some things from all players:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Play fair: &quot;Don't be a Dick!&quot; If you would not want the actions done to you, it is likely another player does not want those actions done to them either.</li>
            <li>Treat each other with respect and lend a hand if needed</li>
            <li>Know the rules, have the rule book with you at Camp and know how your character &quot;works&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <h3 class="title">LCO Limit Policy</h3>
          <p>Refuge LARP Portland and Seattle have approved the following policy change. This policy will be enforced beginning August 1, 2013. The policy is roughly in line with what has been set for the National events.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the time of initial Logistics check-in for an event, each PC may check in no more than <strong>20</strong> LCO rituals.</li>
<li>An LCO item must be completely checked-in or left at home; items may not be &#8220;split&#8221; and partially checked-in. LCO items must be entirely below the cap to be brought in. This is to avoid confusion later on during the event as to which rituals are &#8220;active&#8221; and which are not.</li>
<li>All LCO items count against this limit, no matter which chapter they originate from.</li>
<li>Any LCO item marked as an &#8220;Artifact&#8221; is exempt from this limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following rituals do not count against this limit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spirit Link</li>
<li>Spirit Lock</li>
<li>Item Recall</li>
<li>Preserve Duration</li>
<li>Permanent Duration</li>
<li>Boost Duration</li>
<li>Extend Battle Magic Duration</li>
<li>Resist Destroy Magic</li>
<li>Investiture</li>
<li>Render Indestructible</li>
<li>Render Indestructible Improved</li>
<li>Any ritual which is immobile once cast (Limited Circle of Power, Warder Glyph, Circle Lock, Stable Foundation, Proscribe, etc.)</li>
<li>Any ritual marked as &#8220;Role Play Only&#8221; (RPO)</li>
<li>Any ritual which lasts less than 5 days from the time of casting (Ritual of Woe, Whispering Wind, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>All rituals which are not specifically exempt as per the list above count against this limit, including such &#8220;times ever&#8221; rituals as Enchant and Skill Store.</p>
<p>LCO Master Constructs count as the following number of LCO Rituals based on how many points they are built with:</p>
<ol>
<li>15 points: 5 rituals</li>
<li>30 points: 9 rituals</li>
<li>45 points: 13 rituals</li>
<li>55 points: 17 rituals</li>
<li>60 points: 19 rituals</li>
</ol>
<p>LCO rituals only apply to this limit once they have been cast. A player may bring as many uncast LCO ritual scrolls into game as they wish, so long as they otherwise follow the guidelines of this policy.</p>
<p>The intent is that no player utilize more than 20 applicable LCO rituals at once. Temporary exceptions may be made in the heat of battle so that game play is not interrupted (e.g. when a teammate throws you their magic sword so you can strike the attacking Death Knight, you don&#8217;t need to ask &#8220;how many LCO rits does this have on it?&#8221;), but players who are found to intentionally violate this policy (such as consistently asking other players to &#8220;check in&#8221; LCO rits which they then use for the rest of the event above and beyond the 20 ritual limit) will be sanctioned appropriately as per any other policy violation.</p>
<p>Players with more than 20 LCO rituals as of August 1, 2013 have the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Permanently divest themselves of some items in-game before the limit goes into place.</li>
<li>&#8220;Sell back&#8221; items which exceed the limit to the originating chapter (Oregon or Seattle only) as per the following formula:
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>(CP cost for the ritual * months of remaining duration) / original months of duration</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, they will get the original cost of the ritual back as Chapter Points, prorated for how long the ritual has been in effect. Should a player have an LCO ritual which is not currently in the GS list, they should contact the chapter&#8217;s staff and a cost will be determined based on a standard formula.</li>
<li>Only bring 20 LCO rituals to any particular game going forward, leaving items with rituals over the limit out of game.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="title">Ritual Purchase List</h3>
<p>Below is the list of ritual scrolls that may be purchased with Chapter Points in Refuge LARP Portland. If a scroll has multiple difficulties available, you select the level of difficulty you purchase it at. If, at the time of casting, you choose to cast it at a lower difficulty, you may do so, however, you may never cast one of these LCO scrolls at a higher casting difficulty. When you purchase a scroll, it will be marked as requiring no components. However, if you choose to spellcraft off of an LCO ritual scroll, you may do so, expending listed components as normal.</p>
<p>LCO Reagents may be purchased for 90 Chapter Points. Any ritual that utilizes an LCO reagent renders the rituals results LCO. If you wish to bring an LCO magic item to another chapter, you should first review that chapter&#8217;s LCO transfer policy.</p>
<p>Rituals must be cast in-game! You may use them at an event, a game day, or even during a custom-mod.</p>
<p>Some rituals have been intentionally excluded from this list. Refuge LARP Portland, in conjunction with Refuge LARP Seattle, have come to an agreement to omit certain rituals from our LCO list. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask, though! As always, the Alliance Oregon plot team and owner reserve the right to change this list without notice, as fits the needs of the chapter.</p>
<p>The following ritual scrolls are available for purchase with Chapter Stamps. If you would like to purchase one or more, please send an email <a href="mailto:logistics@refugelarpportland.com">Refuge Portland Logistics</a>.</p>
<p>Portalnd Plot and NPC Guild members will be allowed to purchase the magic items outright, given that they likely have no in-game ties to the regular resources (such as the Caravan of Wonders or other NPC ritual casters, for example) available to the playerbase.</p>
