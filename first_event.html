								<p>What is your first event going to be like? What can you do to prepare? We these questions and more in the guide below!</p>
								<ul>
									<li>What is my first event going to be like?</li>
									<p>No one can really prepare you for your first event. You'll be meeting new, supportive people; fighting surprising and unusual bad guys; and struggling for victory against the ultimate evils of the world. It's a ton of fun, and you'll have a blast with a good attitude!</p>
									<p>On the evening of your first event, you'll come to camp and probably want to find the tavern as soon as you get to the site. The tavern is where the PCs hang out, and usually nearby where logistics sets up. You can ask anyone you run across where the tavern is, and they should be able to point you in the right direction. Once you're at the tavern, you can ask Logistics for some information about where you're sleeping. They should be able to direct you to either NPC or PC cabins, as needed. From there, you'll want to go to your cabin and unload.</p>
									
									<h3>PCs</h3>
									<p>If you're a PC, your next steps will be to introduce yourself to your cabin-mates, and getting dressed. You'll want to get garbed up and get whatever makeup you have on. Once you're fully garbed, you'll need to get your weapons and armour checked by a marshal. Marshals are our rules experts, and can usually be found in the Tavern, if you need to find one. You'll want to bring your wallet, if you didn't prepay, and head to the Tavern, to get checked over.</p>
									<p>Once your armour is evaluated and your weapons are checked, you'll be able to go to logistics and check in. Logistics will ask you for your money (if you didn't prepay), and give you all your tags, your battleboards, your character card, and anything else you might have waiting for you. If you have any questions about what your items mean, you can ask logistics, a marshal, or another player. They should be able to help you get everything sorted.</p>
									<p>Once you're done with all that, you can go to the tavern, have dinner (if you haven't eaten yet), and hang out with other PCs waiting to come into game. If there's no one in the tavern, try checking back in with your cabin-mates and introducing yourself there. Around 9pm, we'll have opening announcements in the tavern. Opening anouncements is when Plot and other members of the community will make announcements about the game. We might hear some rules clarifications, some introductions, and the like. Then the Plot Team will give you the necesary information for the weekend. Then, once things are sorted, they'll talk about how lay on happens. Most of the time, there's a "soft lay on," meaning you can just come into game whenever and go around RPing until the action starts. If there's a "hard lay on," you'll want to follow Plot's directions and join up with the PCs for whatever the big event is. There might also be a new player orientation, in which case, you'll want to go to that before you go into game.</p>
									<p>Either way, once you're in game (IG), you'll stay IG all weekend, unless you need some break time, go for a cigarette, or are waiting for a small story/combat adventure known as a module (mod). If you need to go out of game (OOG), please put your fist on your head, or put on a white headband. Otherwise, you are considered to be IG and people will interact with you as if you are IG. If at any point you want to check in with someone, ask an OOG question, or what have you, a quick fist-on-head-then-ask-your-question action is totally normal. Just be mindful of not staying OOG too long. If you need an extended break, or want to try something new, you can always come double-hook. This is where you come to Monster Camp, and become an NPC for an hour or so. We'll have things for you to do in Monster Camp, and you can try your hand at NPCing for a little bit. You can also come to Monster Camp if you're stressed and need a break, or just want to check in and ask questions. Please note that Monster Camp might be getting ready for a big town fight, so you might get spoiled for something that's about to happen by coming by (or be recruited to join the bad guys for a fight!), or you might be asked to wait for a little while. Either way, you're still welcome to come by if you need to.</p>
									<p>Big fights tend to happen Friday night, midday Saturday and Saturday evening. These fights are usually called "town fights" because they are big enough that the entire town can participate. This is not a guaranteed schedule, but a common enough one that it's what is generally expected by the player base. When you aren't engaged in a town fight or getting ready for one, you can RP with your fellow PCs and NPCs or you can go looking for Info Cards. Info Cards are little miniature adventures out in the woods. These pieces of printer paper (usually white, but occasionally a different colour - the colours don't mean much unless plot says so at opening) are usually stuffed in clear plastic protector sleeves, and may come with other things inside too. The front of the page will indicate what the story hook is - maybe a noise in the trees, or a dark cave in front of you - and then give you some options to engage with the story. You can investigate futher, or if you have the special skills or features listed on the front of the card, you might even be able to get more information or a prize! All the details and information for how to engage with the card will be available on the card. Please only read and follow the directions for skills you have, as anything else will be considered cheating, and if you're caught, you might wind up being disciplined or even sent home from the game.</p>
									<p> Most Info Cards let you leave and go find some people, then come back (we generally ask for a max of 6-8 people per Info Card). That's totally okay, unless the card says it's an ambush and that you need to immediately report to Monster Camp. If you see that on a card, please follow the directions and come to Monster Camp immediately, without gathering friends who weren't already in your immediate vicinity.</p>
									<p>Info Cards are a great way to gather information and special things that may be useful to the plotlines for the weekend. Going with a group - even if it's a high-level group or one you don't know well - is a great way to meet people IG and OOG, and learn more about the game. If you're given a choice, they're super fun! Go!</p>
									<p>The weekend will generally end on a Sunday morning, whereupon there will be some kind of leisurely activities. Some weekends there will be auctions for magic items and scrolls found in the town fights, while other weekends there will be meetings and discussions, while still other times there will be fights that take place. It's generally worthwhile to come into game on Sunday morning, if for no other reason than to get involved in downtime actions.</p>
									<p>Downtimes are actions that take place between games. Each player gets 1 group action and 1 solo action (which can be swapped for a second group action). For group actions, one person emails plot and CC's everyone with the description of what you want to do. Then each player responds with "I'm in." This must be done by 11:59pm on the Sunday 2 weeks after game, at the latest. Solo downtimes are the same, but you're the only person who emails, and you don't need to respond with "I'm in." Plot will take what you write them and write a small story for you, and send it back to you by the Sunday before the next game. These downtimes are great introductions to NPCs, and also fantastic ways to forward your own goals. Maybe you want to become a knight? You can do downtime actions that introduce you to a knightly NPC, or that help you do something a knight asked you to do in game to gain their favour. You can find out more <a href="downtimes.html">on this page about downtimes</a>.</p>
									<p>After the event is over, once we hit "game off," usually around noon on Sunday, there will be closing announcements, and then we'll clean up Monster Camp and go to afters. Afters is a gathering at a local restaurant and is not an official game activity. It's just a place to go an hang around with PCs and NPCs alike and eat some lunch! It's a great deal of fun, and strongly encouraged for folk to attend, but, again, not required.</p>
									
									<h3>NPCs</h3>
									<p>If you're NPCing, your next step will be Monster Camp. Monster Camp is where the NPCs and Plot Team hang out all weekend, creating the stories for the PCs. Monster Camp is an Out of Game (OOG) space, so no need to worry about being In Game (IG) all weekend! Someone at Monster Camp will direct you to your cabin, where you can unpack your stuff and get changed into your black clothes.</p>
									<p>From there, you'll want to come back to Monster Camp to help unpack! If you arrive later, unpacking may already be done, at which point you'll probably just hang around and talk until Plot shows up to explain the plot for the weekend. Once Plot has explained the weekend's story, you'll get a chance to look over the binder, which explains the plot in much greater detail, and pick an NPC or three (coloquially known as "townies") to be for the weekend. These NPCs will be your NPCs every time you come back to game in this campaign, so choose wisely! (You can totally add new ones if you want later, so this isn't really as big a deal as it could be.) Once you have your NPC assignment, you can choose some garb for them and get ready to go in, or not.</p>
									<p>Around 9pm, we'll have opening announcements in the tavern. Opening anouncements is when Plot and other members of the community will make announcements about the game. We might hear some rules clarifications, some introductions, and the like. Then the Plot Team will give you the necesary information for the weekend. Then, once things are sorted, they'll talk about how lay on happens. Most of the time, there's a "soft lay on," meaning you can just come into game whenever and go around RPing until the action starts. If there's a "hard lay on," you'll want to follow Plot's directions for whatever the big event is. There might also be a new player orientation, in which case, you'll want to go to that before you go into game.</p>
									<p>The standard schedule for the weekend involves big town fights Friday night, Saturday midday and Saturday night. At other times than that, you might be out RPing as your townie NPCs, preparing or engaging in smaller fights, or running Info Cards for the PCs who stop by. Info Cards are little miniature adventures out in the woods. These pieces of printer paper (usually white, but occasionally a different colour - the colours don't mean much unless plot says so at opening) are usually stuffed in clear plastic protector sleeves, and may come with other things inside too. The front of the page will indicate what the story hook is - maybe a noise in the trees, or a dark cave in front of the PCs - and then give them some options to engage with the story. Your job, as an NPC, is to bring this card to life. This might involve some RP, or, most likely, some fighting. NPCs get a chance to be the opposite side of these Info Cards from the PCs, usually, although sometimes they are on the same side. Either way, you bring the world to life by playing on these Info Cards, and they are super fun!</p>
									<p>When you aren't on Info Cards or getting ready for a fight or RPing, you'll likely be chilling with the friends you've made in Monster Camp. You can take naps when you need to, drink water, eat snacks, and talk about everything and nothing. It's great camraderie, and so much fun!</p>
									<p>After the event is over, once we hit "game off," usually around noon on Sunday, there will be closing announcements, and then we'll clean up Monster Camp and go to afters. Afters is a gathering at a local restaurant and is not an official game activity. It's just a place to go an hang around with PCs and NPCs alike and eat some lunch! It's a great deal of fun, and strongly encouraged for folk to attend, but, again, not required.</p>
									
									<li>What can I do to prepare for my first event?</li>
									<p>The biggest thing you can do to prep for your first event is to have a good attitude! This is a game!! We're here to have fun! If you can bring a good attitude to game, you'll have a great time and you'll enjoy yourself and the others around you! Huzzah!</p>
									<p>Once you've got the good attitude, you can do a number of other things to prepare. If you learn best from a rulebook, skimming the rulebook is a great idea. If not, that's fine, you can learn in game like many of us did.</p>
									<p>You should definitely try talking to the <a href="mailto:newplayer@refugelarpportland.com">New Player Representative</a> and reading through the FAQs posted on this site. Also, be familiar with the different policies such as the romantic RP policy and the anti-harassment policy. These can all be found under the "Policies" tab above.</p>
									<p>Other things to do to prepare for the event include making your character in the online database (both NPCs and PCs need to make a character in the database in order to register for the event, but the NPC character can be blank), registering for the event, and reaching out on our <a href="contact.html">social media pages</a> so you can get to know people!</p>
									<p>Finally, remember that this is just a game, and that real life beats the game all the time. If you need us, we're here for you, and if you need to bail for health reasons or whatever, you're fine. We're a supportive community, and we really appreciate that in others. Come and join us and enjoy!</p>
									
									<li>What are some things I should know going into my first event?</li>
									<p>Firstly, know that events are usually really COLD. If you have trouble with extreme temperatures, be sure to bring lots of layers and warm clothes. If you're PCing, be sure to bring clothes to wear under your garb, and a cloak to wear over the top. If you're NPCing, a black hoodie, layers of black clothing, and lots of socks are your best friends. Occasionally we have really hot events, but even those tend to get cold at night. Be prepared for anything with a good set of layers!</p>
									<p>Secondly, events can be quite wet. Not much of a shock for the Pacific Northwest, but a true statement nonetheless. It's strongly suggested that you bring extra clothes in case you get wet and need to change. For NPCs, this means extra black clothes. For PCs this may mean you want to invest in two sets of garb just to be safe. One of my first events, I tripped and fell in a puddle of mud then slid down a hill. I was really glad I had extra clothing that day!</p>
									<p>The people of Refuge are REALLY happy to have you, no matter whether you're a PC or an NPC. You are NOT bothering people by asking for rules clarifications, being confused, or struggling to understand the events. Almost everyone remembers their first game, and they all had similar experiences. We love talking LARP, breathing LARP, and living LARP. If you have questions, we'll answer them.</p>
									<p>It's also important to recognize that time and place are important. We prefer to stay in game all weekend, if we can! If you have a question about something, try and frame it as an in-game question, or try and find a private moment to ask the question of someone nearby. You can also wait until you're in a space where you're waiting for a module (or mod), and people are hanging out OOG for asking your question. People might ask you to stay in game if you just shout out OOG questions in the tavern in the middle of an important meeting. Just try and keep an eye on the space. And when in doubt, feel free to come to Monster Camp! Monster Camp is always an OOG space, so you won't be interrupting RP there!</p>
									<p>Refuge Portland is a PG-13 game. Please do your best to abide by this theming. Swear words are discouraged but still used, especially when things get really emotional. That's fine. If you're dropping "f-bombs" every other word, you might get a talking-to about time and place. Likewise, Refuge does not allow themes that engage in sexual violence of any sort, and we try and keep general sexual themes to a minimum. Finally, use your best judgement. If you are around smaller children, who can be found at Refuge Portland games, please keep your descriptions of the carnage and violence of adventurer life to a minimum, in favour of lighter themes. By all means, talk about the monsters you killed and how you killed them, but maybe don't describe the blood that was coating the field and whatnot. ;)</p>
									<p>If you aren't sure what's going on in a particular scene, feel free to ask! Some people might not explain thoroughly, but most people are more than happy to explain the major plot points of the weekend, and how the events of the past have influenced this weekend. You get SO MUCH MORE out of the game if you engage with it and act nosy and curious than if you are standoffish and aloof, even if that's what your character would be. We call this "positive metagaming," which means you are using out of game knowledge - that people have more fun if they are nosy and curious - to affect your character's choices in game. As long as it's for the good of the story, positive metagaming is a really powerful tool.</p>
									<p>Finally, it's important to note that you will probably feel a lot of things during your first event. You might be frustrated or confused at various times, or you might be completely elated and excited. All responses are normal responses to your first event. You're surrounded by new people, interacting with a story you don't know much, if anything, about, and you are supposed to be fighting for a cause you may not feel strongly about. But you're also interacting with brand new people who love the sport with all their hearts, who are welcoming and supportive, you'll be crushing monsters and rising triumphant over evils of the world, and solving problems and puzzles. Even for experienced players, the game can be alternatingly frustrating and so much fun. Or occasionally so much fun because it's frustrating. If you're struggling, feel free to come to Monster Camp and talk to a plot member. They can help point you in the right direction, if all else is failing.</p>

							<h3 class="title">Cory's Suggested starting Class Builds</h3>
							<p>Cory is not only the Chapter Owner of Refuge Calgary, he loves to build new characters with people. He asks a lot of questions to new players to help them start forming a concept, and then helps them to build towards that concept. <em><strong>Words of wisdom: </strong>LARP takes Time! We are going into our 8th season and only now do we have characters that are above 20th level. Don't get discouraged when you see players doing a lot of damage, casting powerful spells etc. They have been playing for a while!</em></p>

								<p><em>&quot;</em><em>Now the one thing you will note is I have not given builds for the
										&quot;Hybrid

										character, stick with one of the above basics. You can switch into a Spellsword,
										Adept or Scout later

										without too many

								<p><em>One of my best pieces of advise is this: Plan for the long term after your first
