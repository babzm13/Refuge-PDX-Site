						<p>We welcome minors aged 8 and up at our game. Before deciding to bring an underage participant to an Refuge game, please keep in mind that while we aim for a PG-13 environment, we run a game primarily populated by adults in intense situations, violently combating monsters in the dark. There are no overt sexual themes to the game that we run, but strong language and violent encounters are reasonably common. Not only will different people have different levels of tolerance for the dramatic situations they find themselves in, but not all younger players will have the level of maturity necessary to participate in a complex game among adults. Should you feel that a young player is mature and capable enough to participate at our events, we welcome them to give our game a try. However, due to safety concerns, there are a few restrictions regarding their ability to participate.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>For everybody under 18 years old, we need a parent’s signature on a consent form, which should include emergency contact info and medical/allergy information in case of an emergency.</li>
							<li>Anybody under 16 must be accompanied by an adult guardian, participating in the same capacity as the minor (that is, PCing or NPCing). This does not need to be a parent (though it could be), but this person needs to be able to be responsible in case of injury, and willing to leave game with the child in case of a severe behavioral issue.</li>
							<li>Anybody under 14 must participate as a Page (see the Page Policy, below), and may not NPC.</li>
							<li>Finally, we do not accept players under age 8.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>It is the intention of Refuge Portland to do our best to safeguard against potential injury to its participants due to age, medical condition, or safety hazard. As such, a Page policy is outlined below. Note that this supersedes and overrides in all ways the sample Page policy outlined in the Refuge rulebook, including the “Page I slay you” call which is ineffective in Refuge Portland.</p>

						<h3>Gaining Page Status</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Any player may participate as a Page by his or her own choice. Players with medical issues that may affect their safety in combat may be required to take Page status to play the game.</li>
							<li>Pages must wear a colored headband to denote their Page status, as defined below.</li>
							<li>Any player under the age of 14 is under mandatory Page status. A parent or legal guardian must be on-site and is responsible for the player’s actions, and must remove the player from the site if asked. The parent or guardian must keep track of the player and be able to know where the player is at all times. Children under the age of 8 are not allowed to participate in any fashion, even as Pages.</li>
							<li>A marshal may recommend that the executive staff place a player under Page status due to any condition that the marshal deems necessary to provide for the safety of Refuge Portland’s participants, such as health conditions or a player having multiple safety violations marked against them.</li>
						</ol>

						<h3>Page Conduct</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Any Page (whether they are a Page by choice, age, medical, or disciplinary reason) that is disruptive, acts in an immature fashion, does not obey the rules, or in any other way is deemed to be harmful to the game may be asked to leave.</li>
							<li>Pages may not enter combat in any way, including pouring healing potions in unconscious bodies in the middle of battle (though others may drag these bodies to the Pages for healing outside the combat zone). They must stay safely outside any combat zone. This means being sufficiently far that the combat will not sweep into their position before they can safely remove themselves, and is always a minimum of ten feet but may require further distance based on the situation.</li>
							<li>There are effects that might prevent a Page from leaving a combat area when they would otherwise need to do so. These include but are not limited to unconsciousness, Pin, Web, Prison, etc. etc. If such a situation occurs, the Page should call a Hold and move themselves out of the way, keeping the effect once the Lay On occurs. Other players are expected to resolve the situation in a safe and appropriate manner – for example, a horde of players should not continue following a Pinned Page which would cause multiple Holds to be called.</li>
							<li>Pages may never carry in-game weapons or weapon tags.</li>
							<li>Pages may carry in-game items, and can be searched as per the search rules.</li>
							<li>A Page may be affected by a normal combatant if the combatant’s weapon is within five feet, by having the combatant announce “Page, I [affect] you.” Legal affects are any that can be applied within the Refuge rules, such as (but not limited to): Spell Name, Gas Name, Waylay, Slay, Stun Limb, Disarm, Shatter Your [item], or Eviscerate. Applicable spell incants or weapon skill verbals must still be used (For example: “I call forth a 40 Flame Bolt! Page I 40 Flame Bolt you!” or “Page, I Disarm Potion you!”). Additionally, under the same conditions a Page may be struck for damage by adding “Page” to the damage call (ie, “Page, 4 Normal!” or “Page, 300 Magic!”). The damage called must follow normal Refuge rules for calling damage.</li>
							<li>In response to any of the above, a Page may call any legal defenses they have at their disposal.</li>
							<li>Pages earn XP for each event just like any other player. If they were a Page due to their age, then upon reaching the age of 14 they may create a new character with the same amount of XP and deaths or rearrange their current character with the XP they have earned.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<h3>Basic and Advanced Pages</h3>
						<p>There are two distinct levels of Page status:</p>

						<p><b>Basic</b> – All Pages begin at this level or participation. Basic Pages may not purchase any weapon skill or carry a weapon in game. They may purchase spells and alchemy, but are only allowed to touch cast spells, and may not throw gas globes. Basic level Pages must wear a yellow headband clearly displaying the word ‘PAGE’ to denote this status.</p>
						
						<p><b>Advanced</b> – Once a Page has demonstrated good knowledge of the rules and an ability to interact with the game in a positive manner, they may be granted Advanced Page status as defined below. Advanced level Pages must wear an orange headband to denote this status.
						<br>To become an Advanced Page, a player must take the Advanced Page test. They must have played at least one full Refuge LARP event or gameday to be allowed to take the test, and must have displayed both roleplaying competency and understanding of the rules as determined by at least two staff members or marshals present at that Refuge event or gameday.</p>

						<p>Any player wishing to play as an Advanced Page must take the Advanced Page test to do so. Even players who are temporarily Pages due to medical or disciplinary issues must take the test to use the Advanced Page rules.</p>

						<p>Advanced Pages must follow all rules for Pages except for the following changes.</p>

						<p>Advanced Pages may not be affected by “Page, I [affect] you” calls which would normally be packet-delivered. These effects must actually be thrown at the Page as they would a normal player, and the Page may use any means at their disposal (physically dodging the packet, running away, etc.) that a normal player would have.</p>

						<p>Advanced Pages may interact with combat so long as the combat is individual. This means that the Advanced Page, and one other participant, are the only ones involved in combat in the immediate area. In this situation and this situation only, the Advanced Page is not required to leave the combat area and may in fact initiate combat. As soon as other participants become involved in the combat, however, the Advanced Page must attempt to leave the combat area and stay a safe distance away from other participants just like a Basic Page must. This means that an Advanced Page might initiate a combat which they must immediately run from if their target gains immediate assistance from others in the area.</p>

						<p>If an Advanced Page is forced to leave a combat area, they may actively defend themselves via use of packets as they leave the combat area. Advanced Pages who are seen abusing this rule to stay in a combat area longer than necessary may be stripped of Advanced Page status immediately by any Marshal if necessary.</p>

						<p>Advanced Pages may purchase the Archery skill. They may use Crossbows only with this skill and may pick up, carry, and utilize Crossbow physreps and tags.</p>

						<p>Advanced Pages may purchase the Thrown Weapon skill. They may use any Alliance-legal thrown weapon.</p>
